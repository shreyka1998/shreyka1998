## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm Shreyka Kale, a results-oriented Power BI Developer with 3.3 years of experience in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I‚Äôve delivered end-to-end BI solutions across diverse industries including finance, healthcare (MEDSPA), and telematics (GEOTAB).

üíº I specialize in:

* SQL for data extraction and transformation

* Microsoft Fabric (Lakehouses, Notebooks, OneLake Integration)

* Power Automate & Power Apps for report automation

* Interactive, scalable dashboards using slicers, bookmarks, and drillthroughs
